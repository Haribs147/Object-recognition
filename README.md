# Real-Time Object Recognition using YOLO

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and train a model for real-time object recognition using neural networks. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture was utilized for its efficiency and effectiveness in object detection tasks. The project involved testing various versions of YOLO on different datasets to evaluate their performance.
