# Real-Time Object Recognition using YOLO

## Project Overview

This project aimed to develop and train a model for real-time object recognition using neural networks. The YOLO architecture was utilized for its efficiency and effectiveness in object detection tasks. The project involved testing various versions of YOLO on different datasets to evaluate their performance and creating your own custom dataset.
